Type: Beginner Level
Task 01: Iris Flower Classification ML Project

The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities. In this project I have use SVC model and checked the accuracy of model using Iris flower classification.

Task 02: Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.

Type: Intermediate Level
Task 03: Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’. As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

Task 04: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Type: Advanced Level
Task 05: Develop A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting


Neural network machine learning project with the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge and using Tensorflow and CNN. It has a very user-friendly interface that’s ideal for beginners.
